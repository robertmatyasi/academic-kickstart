I am a PhD candidate in Philosophy at the University of Toronto. My primary interests are in 17th and 18th century philosophy (especially Spinoza and other rationalists) and metaphysics.

I am from [Pécs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pécs), Hungary. Aside from philosophy, I enjoy making and consuming food and music, going to the movies, and reading fiction.

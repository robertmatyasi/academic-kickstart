**Paper in the history of philosophy**

*under review*

**Spinoza on Determinable Powers and Species**

It is a well-known difficulty that Spinoza seems to have an incoherent theory of objective similarity. The problem is that his account seems to employ two irreconcilable theories of essence: one that allows only individual essences, and another that only allows essences that are shared between members of a species. I argue that Spinoza does not vacillate between naive Platonism and thoroughgoing Nominalism: his account of essence relates the overlapping determinable powers of individuals.

**Spinoza on Objective Being and Modality**

This paper is about Spinoza's doctrine of universal intelligibility. In particular, his commitment to the thesis that concepts and objects do not exceed each other---for Spinoza everything is conceived; and every adequately conceived thing exists. I argue that Spinoza's commitment to intelligibility is better understood in connection to Spinoza's modal commitments, namely from his thoroughgoing necessitarianism.

**Moore on the Unreality of Agent-Relative Value (with Damian Melamedoff)**

In his Principia Ethica Moore argues that Ethical Egoism is internally inconsistent, since there is no sense of "good for" that can vary from agent to agent. In this paper, we argue that Moore's argument can be better appreciated by comparing it to another contemporary argument: McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time. By appealing to Kit Fine's recent reconstruction of McTaggart's argument, we show that Moore's argument is structurally identical to McTaggart's. We then show that extant responses to Moore's argument are all analogous to some of the standard responses to McTaggart's. We conclude by examining the prospects of non-standard responses to Moore's argument, and tentatively endorse a fragmentalist account of agent-relative value.

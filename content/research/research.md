In my dissertation I examine Spinoza’s rich and original metaphysics of ordinary objects and organisms. These entities fall in the middle between Spinoza’s well-known commitments in his fundamental metaphysics (rationalism, substance monism, deter- minism) and his psychology and ethical theory. Both of these domains are considered central to Spinoza’s philosophical project in the Ethics, yet much work remains to be done to connect them in a satisfying way. My goal is to reexamine key topics in Spinoza’s metaphysics by focusing on some less studied aspects of his thought. In each chapter of the dissertation, I discuss a specific issue in Spinoza’s metaphysics: composition, modality, and universals.

In the future I am planning to continue exploring Spinoza's philosophy and its relevance to contemporary issues with a focus on metaphysical dependence and issues of gender and race. In addition, I will expand my research to his less studied contemporaries. I am particularly interested in the parallels between Spinoza, Margaret Cavendish, and Anne Conway.
